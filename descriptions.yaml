      Possible values for [`type`](#attribute-type) seem to be:

      * Known to work:
        * `GPE_CAMERA` — Combine with [`camera`](#attribute-camera) to specify a
          camera angle to switch to.
        * `GPE_CELEBRATION` — Use without additional attributes to trigger a small
                audio/visual celebration effect.
      * Untested:
        * `GPE_AUDIO`
        * `GPE_DAILYTARGET`
        * `GPE_ADD_ROADPROP`
        * `GPE_PLAY_ANIM`

      Doesn't seem to have any effect.

      It's seen on several built-in Zwift workouts, always on non-flat intervals with a value of `20`.
      Presumably it refers to the power steps in the interval's ramp.

  type:

      The type of event to trigger. See
      [`<gameplayevent>`](#element-gameplayevent) for more info.

  camera:
    description: |
      Specify the camera angle to change to in a
      [`<gameplayevent>`](#element-gameplayevent). Not tested, but the
      value appears to correspond to the numeric camera shortcut keys.
